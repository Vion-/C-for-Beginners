[C#] Project 1 - Vehicle Library

This is a personal project to review all that was learned during the C# for beginners class in MVA.
It is currently work in progress and so, the idea of the program itself and the requirements have not been defined.
As the different parts of the code are created they will come together here.

As of now, the idea is to create a library management program for handling vehicle information.
The aplication will be username and password protected.
It will be possible to add, remove and look up different types of cars in the database (after they have been inputted).
