[C#] Project 1 - Vehicle Library

This is a personal project to review all that was learned during the C# for beginners class in MVA.
It is currently work in progress and so, the idea itself of the program requirements have not been defined.
As the different parts of the code are createdm they will come together here.

As of now, the idea is to have somekind of vehicle library.
